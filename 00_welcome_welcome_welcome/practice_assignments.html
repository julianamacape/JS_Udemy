                <p><strong>🔥 The best way of learning JavaScript is by practicing it!</strong></p>
                <p>That's why I created an assignment for each lecture in the JavaScript Fundamentals Sections Part 1
                    and 2 (about 25 assignments in both sections).</p>
                <p>The goal of these assignments is that you can immediately apply the concepts you learn in each video,
                    <strong>by writing code on your own</strong>. This will help you a lot!</p>
                <p>So, download the assignments PDF from this lecture, and then, after you complete each lecture, find
                    the assignment for the video you just watched, starting right now ✌️</p>
                <p>Happy coding! 😁</p>
